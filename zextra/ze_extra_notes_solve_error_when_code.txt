The error message indicates that you have local changes in the file `Assignment_Python_For_loop/assignmen_Python_For_loop_solution.ipynb` that haven't been committed or stashed. Git is preventing the pull operation to avoid overwriting your local changes.

To resolve this, you have a few options:

### Option 1: Commit your changes

If you want to keep the changes you've made to the file, commit them before pulling:

```bash
git add Assignment_Python_For_loop/assignmen_Python_For_loop_solution.ipynb
git commit -m "Committing my changes before pull"
git pull origin main
```

This sequence of commands stages and commits your local changes and then pulls the latest changes from the remote repository.

### Option 2: Stash your changes

If you don't want to commit the changes but want to save them for later, you can stash them:

```bash
git stash
git pull origin main
git stash apply
```

The `git stash` command saves your local changes in a temporary area, allowing you to pull the changes from the remote repository. The `git stash apply` command then reapplies your stashed changes.

### Option 3: Discard your changes

If you don't care about your local changes and want to get the latest version from the remote repository:

```bash
git checkout -- Assignment_Python_For_loop/assignmen_Python_For_loop_solution.ipynb
git pull origin main
```

This will discard your local changes in the specified file and pull the latest changes from the remote repository.

Choose the option that best fits your workflow and whether you want to keep, stash, or discard your local changes.

    "What are metaclasses in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Metaclasses are a deep and advanced topic in Python. Essentially, they are \"classes of a class\" that define how a class behaves. The default metaclass is `type`, but you can create your own metaclass to customize class behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**17. Question:**\n",
    "Describe the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and its implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The GIL is a mutex (or a lock) that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time in CPython (the standard Python implementation). This means that even on multi-core systems, only one thread is executed at a time. This can be a bottleneck for CPU-bound programs, but it is not generally an issue for I/O-bound programs.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **staticmethod**: Doesn't take any specific first parameter (neither self nor cls), and acts just like a regular function but belongs to a class's namespace.\n",
    "- **classmethod**: Takes the class as its first parameter (usually named `cls`). It can be called on the class itself, rather than an instance.\n",
    "- **Instance method**: Takes the instance (object) as its first parameter (usually named `self`) and operates on it.\n",

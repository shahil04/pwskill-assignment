              "'Flask templates are essential components in web development using the Flask framework. Let’s explore their significance and usage:\\n\\nWhat Are Flask Templates?\\nTemplates are files containing both static data and placeholders for dynamic content.\\nThey allow you to separate presentation logic (HTML) from application logic (Python code).\\nFlask uses the Jinja template library to render templates1.\\nHow Are They Used?\\nCreating Templates:\\nYou define templates (usually in the templates/ directory) with placeholders for dynamic data.\\nThese placeholders are enclosed in double curly braces (e.g., {{ variable_name }}).\\nRendering Templates:\\nIn your Flask application, you associate a template with a view function.\\nThe view function processes data and passes it to the template.\\nThe template is then rendered with the specific data to produce the final HTML document.\\nDynamic Content:\\nYou can inject dynamic content (e.g., user names, database results) into templates using variables.\\nLayouts and Inheritance:\\nFlask supports template inheritance.\\nYou can create a base template (layout) and extend it in other templates.\\nThis ensures consistent styling across multiple pages.\\nFilters and Control Structures:\\nUse filters (e.g., date formatting, string manipulation) to modify template data.\\nEmploy control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals) to handle dynamic content.\\nForms and User Input:\\nTemplates handle form rendering and user input display.\\nStatic Files and Media:\\nTemplates link to static assets (CSS, JavaScript) for styling and interactivity.'"
